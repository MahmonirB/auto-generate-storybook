# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Before start

Create new .env file with `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxx` key that it's produced `account/api-keys` from `openAI.com` platform.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

This command will create all .stories.tsx files of react component into `/components` folder. If .stories.tsx of some files are available, it won't rewrite it again.
